# Mireia Artigot i Golobardes

I am a Visiting professor at [Pompeu Fabra Law School](http://www.upf.edu/dret), affiliated Professor at the Economics Department of Universitat Pompeu Fabra and at the Escola Superior de Comerç Internacional of Universitat Pompeu Fabra. 
My research combines the study of legal issues, particularly in private law, from an economics perspective. I focus on contracts, torts -  specially product liability - and wills. I am also interested in European law and on European Economic integration.  My research of the law draws from the inputs provided by microeconomics and macroeconomis. 
I hold a Juris Science Doctor (J.S.D) and a Masters  in Laws (LLM) from Cornell Law School, a B.A. in Law and a B.A. in Economics by Universitat Pompeu Fabra. I have been a visiting professor of Brooklyn Law School, the Institut für Wirtschaftsrecht at Kassel Universität, the Montenegro Economics Department and Law School, the University of Trento Law School  and the Center for South African studies of the University of Western Cape. I also served as a law clerk for the Presiding Judge Hon. Edwin H. Stern, Presiding Judge of the New Jersey Appellate Division of the New Jersey Judiciary. I am admitted to practice law in Spain (Barcelona BAR number 39954) and in New York (NY BAR number 39954)
