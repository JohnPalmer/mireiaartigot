# Mireia Artigot i Golobardes

I am a Visiting professor at [Pompeu Fabra Law School](http://www.upf.edu/dret), affiliated Professor at the [Economics Department of Universitat Pompeu Fabra](http://www.econ.upf.edu/en/) and at the [Escola Superior de Comerç Internacional](http://www.esci.upf.edu/en) of Universitat Pompeu Fabra and at [ESADE Law School](http://www.esade.edu/grados/eng/ged). 

My research combines the study of legal issues, particularly in private law, from an economics perspective. I focus on contracts, torts -  specially product liability - and wills. I am also interested in European law and on European Economic integration.  My research of the law draws from the inputs provided by microeconomics and macroeconomis. 

I hold a Juris Science Doctor (J.S.D) and a Masters  in Laws (LLM) from [Cornell Law School](http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/), a B.A. in Law and a B.A. in Economics by [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/en/). I have been a visiting professor of [Brooklyn Law School](https://www.brooklaw.edu/), the [Institut für Wirtschaftsrecht](https://www.uni-kassel.de/fb07/en/institutes/iwr/home.html) at [Kassel Universität](http://www.uni-kassel.de/uni/), the [Montenegro University](http://www.ekonomija.ac.me/) Economics Department and Law School, the [University of Trento](http://www.unitn.it/en) Law School  and the Center for South African studies of the [University of Western Cape](https://www.uwc.ac.za/Pages/default.aspx). I also served as a law clerk for the Presiding Judge Hon. Edwin H. Stern, Presiding Judge of the New Jersey Appellate Division of the [New Jersey Judiciary](http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/). 

I am admitted to practice law in Spain (Barcelona BAR number 39954) and in New York (NY BAR number 4775474).
